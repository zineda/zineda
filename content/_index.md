I’m a data analyst living in Berlin, Germany – originally from Manisa, Turkey where world-famous sultana grapes are grown.

Currently, I’m working in the Inventory Intelligence team at [idealo internet GmbH](https://www.idealo.de/), and supporting our business teams by providing data-driven analyses and research. R is my dominant language professionally. While I’m making statistical analysis and modeling data with R, I find Tableau the best tool for data visualization since it is easy to use and more feature-rich.

My bachelor's degree is in Economics from the [University of Ege](https://ege.edu.tr/) and I studied Data Science and Management (Master of Science) at the [University of Leuphana Lüneburg](https://www.leuphana.de/).

I am always eager to learn and after falling in love with data and design thinking, I will blog mostly about data-related topics (e.g. visualization, statistics, machine learning) and design thinking. My main goal here is to share what I've learned and what I am currently learning.

Other interests I also have, non-data-related, are project management, behavioral science, basketball, travel, podcasts, poem and sci-fi, which I can eventually blog about.
