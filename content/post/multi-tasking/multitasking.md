First, let me say that this is one of the strongest books I read this year ‚Äî well-written, simple, and fun with lots of exercises: *Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* by Jeff Sutherland.

While the book contains a wealth of valuable content about ‚Äúpure‚Äù Scrum and why Agile methodology matters at work. In this post, I‚Äôll focus **only on multitasking** using an exercise provided in the book.

Let me explain why I value this topic. When I started working as a data analyst, I received many ad-hoc requests that needed to be done in a reasonable time frame. As soon as I received a request, I started to play with data, since I was quite excited to see the problem itself and design the solution in my mind. Naturally, I moved that ticket to the "in progress" section on the Kanban board and then came back to another ticket that I had already started before that one. The result? A huge increase in the production of cortisol, the **stress hormone**, as well as a feeling of mental exhaustion.

Whether it makes sense or not, multitasking is a part of our lives. For instance, it seems like a must-have skill for almost any job. If you have ever applied for a position on a job portal, you know what I mean. However, we humans aren‚Äôt made for it. Let's explore this together to understand **why we are not designed for multitasking.**


üìé The only things you need for this exercise are a timer, a pen, and a piece of paper.


Ready?

We will create on the paper a table that consists of three columns and ten rows: numbers from 1-10, Roman numerals, and Latin letters.

Firstly, we will start the timer and write the numbers, Roman numerals, and Latin letters **across columns** as can be seen in the image (*scenario 1*) below.

Scenario 1: Across columns

Now, we will do the same thing, but this time by writing down **across rows** *(scenario 2).*

Scenario 2: Across rows

How much time did that take? To be honest, I've never met a person where the second scenario took less than the first. The lesson?


üëå Doing one thing at a time helps you concentrate more and get more done in less time.



I do not mean multitasking is either a good thing or a bad thing. However, what I am trying to say here is that switching focus between contexts causes a loss of time and even causes stress that can damage memory as you've already experienced with our simple exercise.

Looking forward to hearing your own experiences about multi- or single-tasking!
